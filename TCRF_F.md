## The Cutting Room Floor - Focus


As with many writers and role-players, I've had plenty of ideas which never had a chance to be explored to the point of completion. Still, I don't think those ideas deserve to languish forgotten forever. As such, I'd like to welcome you to a new once-every-time-I-feel-like-it series of blog entries where I explore those ideas that never truly were in the hopes that they inspire something.

Each of these articles will follow a simple format. First we'll explore a bit of prologue to establish the backround in which the character or story existed, then we will explore the ideas that existed for them, and finally I'll offer a few closing thoughts about how they've affected my writing since the time they existed.

With that preamble aside, let us explore that which has been left on The Cutting Room Floor.

# Prologue: In Focus

The investigator who would eventually go by Focus is technically the first 'serious' TTRPG character I ever made. I don't remember if they or Narcissa were created first anymore, but they were the first character for whom I ever made even a portion of a full backstory. 

They were created for a Pathfinder campaign I joined in college. A friend was already running a softly designed improv version of it for their friends, and despite being halfway across the US they asked if I'd like to join. The premise was simple: Each of us as players had been warped to the world of Pathfinder through unknown means, possessed a small shard of a dead god, and by some provenance we all managed to reach level 20 which was where the story proper started. Isekai wasn't as much of a thing at the time as it is today, and generally the players who were already in the game had seen the backstory of their characters as a chance to engage in a sort of idealized wish fulfillment about what it would be like for them to be in such a magical world as the people they already were.

Then, I showed up. Being a bit of an overly egotistical person, I intended for Focus to be a reality check to the more heroic and fantastical stories told by the other players. By the end of the first section of their backstory they'd already been forced by circumstance to look someone in the eyes as they took her life, and things only got worse from there. They died several times, always while pursuing someone who they thought was acting unjustly-- Usually at the hands of some variety of mage. The world had tried to break them, and all that stopped it from happening was a casual disregard for their own life and happiness. With each death their outlook became darker and they became more and more clear on one thing: Magical individuals and nonmagical ones were fundamentally incapable of existing together and it was their job to ensure the former would not harm the latter.

This cynicism coloured everything that would happen to them during the one campaign session we managed to do and the roleplay that followed, but there was some hope to the character as well. As they met the party they made friends (and, in one case, re-met an existing friend), but there was always an undercurrent of distrust to everything they did. An undercurrent which was originally going to be a far more major part of their character.

# Focus' Epic Path: Anathema Rising

I didn't know much about high level Pathfinder when I created this character, so I followed our main GM's suggestion of the kind of character they though I would become in this scenario and let that guide the backstory I crafted. Notably, in a party where everyone else possessed supernatural abilities of some variety or another, they were a pure skill specialist -- An Empiricist Investigator with a specialization in guns.

I didn't adore the design of the kit, but there was one ability which truly spoke to me from a mechanical and flavor perspective. I've included it here for context with the most interesting portion in italics:

> Unfailing Logic (Ex)

> > An empiricist’s grasp of facts and data teaches him to anchor himself in reality, granting resistance to even the most potent illusions. At 4th level, an empiricist gains a +2 insight bonus on all Will saving throws against illusion spells or spell-like abilities that allow a save to disbelieve their effects. In addition he can spend one point from his inspiration pool as an immediate action to use his Intelligence bonus instead of her Wisdom bonus on all such saves for one round. At 8th level, the empiricist’s insight bonus increases to +4. *At 16th level, he gains immunity to all illusion spells and spell-like abilities that allow a save to disbelieve the effects.*

This was an ability which was, in theory, not especially useful save for fighting a few varieties of spellcaster. However, the flavor potential was immense and I decided to run with it. After all, if an ability could render someone entirely immune to illusions then how would it work in flavor? Given the general power-level of the campaign, I decided on a somewhat... Aggressive interpretation. 

As I was deciding what I wished to have happen to Focus as they progressed into Epic levels, that ability and its nature continued to fascinate me. I decided that leaning into it was the best option narratively, and thus the concept of the Anathema was born. 

Focus' character had always been defined by their distance from the other characters (both physically and in outlook), so I decided their shard of divinity should be different as well. I'd decided at the start that I didn't want to give them any magic, so a natural reason would be that their soul had an intrinsic form of anti-magic embedded within it as a result of the shard. My plan was for this to begin to grow yet more powerful as their strength increased, first affecting not just illusion but other forms of magic before beginning to spread to things around them. I was willing to let this go as far as the GM(s) would take it, up to and including their becoming an Anti-God of sorts whose very presence or name unraveled spells and charms. A great equalizer between mages and non-mages, with all the horror that entailed.

The Anathema was meant to represent all that they hated that they weren't, and all that they feared they could be. Its quasi-divine nature gave it thoughts of its own, and those thoughts sought the end of all magic. This, it rationalized, was the only way to ensure true equality.

  

Thematically, this was the choice that would've fit best with what I imagined they wished to do. But they took a different path instead. One which drew them closer to the rest of the party but didn't alter their original intended storyline.

# Focus' Story: Protection At All Costs

Though I had to go back to my notes and the things I'd written for some of the portions of this that related to Focus' character, there was one line from early in the campaign that remained in my mind through all that time. 

The characters were discussing how they wished to go home, and Focus responded with a simple "If you try to go home, I'll kill you myself". As far as they were concerned the things within Pathfinder were far too dangerous and powerful to bring back to Earth, and as the person who focused above all else on protecting the powerless from the powerful they personally put it upon themselves to ensure no one would put Earth at risk. 

At the earlier portions of the campaign this would've manifested as mostly words, but my intention as things continued and the Anathema made itself more manifest in Focus' personality it would become apparent that simply taking others for their word wasn't enough. As long as there was a potential link between Earth and the Planes of Golarion, Earth was at risk. Thus began Focus' true arc, the one that I was afraid to suggest to the GMs: I wanted them to become the final big bad of the campaign. 

Each other enemy the party felled, each challenge they completed, would further reinforce the idea that they were too strong to be allowed to live. As the Anathema’s influence became greater and Focus' power grew, the true nature of their plan would take shape until everyone reached the true zenith of their power and the scope of their plan could be revealed in a single grand betrayal.

I never got to deciding exactly what their plan would be for this event, but its terminal result was obvious. The only way to ensure the safety of the Earth, the place they still somewhat considered home, was to destroy the world they now existed in and all the Planes connected to it. With their nihilistic power at the core of a grand ritual, they wished to commit suicide and take everything else with them in the name of Keeping Their Old Home Safe.

This plotline was meant to be something held in reserve until we were ready to rightly and truly end the campaign. After all, how does one make things a compelling threat to follow up “One of your companions tries to end Everything?” Still, as a swan song for Focus and the rest of the people whose lives they'd forced themselves into I thought it was an interesting way to go.

Thematically, it just made sense to me. Focus’ role was always that of the outsider from both a power perspective and a relationship one. They were a liar, an investigator, someone who always held their cards close to their chest and had an angle prepared to work if they needed it. The logical conclusion of that, I figured, was that they'd prefer to end all of reality than ask for help with their anxieties.

As I said, though, Focus’ character wound up taking a different arc. In part this was because of the nature of the campaign, with us extensively doing written roleplay to progress characters but only playing a handful of sessions to progress numerically. By the time I was having to consider my Epic Path, I'd kinda done the “Resenting a lack of magic” bit to death so I pivoted when I got the chance. Nowadays I think I might've stuck to my guns more, but I'm happy with what happened to Focus eventually. It was certainly a happier outcome for them.

  
  
  

# Lightning Round:

  

These bits aren't big enough for a full write up like the previous ones, but are interesting tidbits I figured I'd share anyway.


**The Dealer’s Real Identity**:

One of the more mysterious portions of Focus’ backstory was The Dealer, a card-playing spirit of sorts which appeared to them whenever they died. I had an original plan for their identity, but discarded it and went for a different option when I realized the GM would almost certainly never go for it. 

Specifically, The Dealer was supposed to be the actual version of me which had been sent over from Earth. Focus, instead, was to be a construct of one player’s memories of me which had been influenced (read: Put through horrific suffering and trauma and induced toward villainy) by The Dealer’s desire to “Make things entertaining”. It wasn't a great idea, so I scrapped it.


**Focus' Box of Tricks**: 

Somewhat unrelated to the plan to betray all their friends, the weird powergamer part of my brain insisted that I make plans to try and kill everyone else in the party if I ever had to. These plans were usually unrelated to things like "rules", and relied on a degree of engineering and ruthlessness that often ran up against the GMs' sensibilities. I don't have any of the plans written down anymore, but I do remember most of them were relatively workable save for one player whose entry was just "She kills me".


**Focus and Gods**: 

One of the more interesting things that came up in the roleplay of the character was Focus' jealousy of those who were in power, most notably Gods. They wanted to be powerful and use that power to help people, and the sight of Gods not intervening in the world's ills was one of the things that incensed them more than anything else. As they interacted with the party, especially those who actively worshipped various gods, their views softened slightly. By the time the campaign was fully canceled, they still wanted the Gods to help people but weren't planning on committing deicide until their final plan reached fruition.


# Epilogue - Out of Focus

This campaign was one of the last ones I played in as a player before joining my newest group, and when I eventually got a chance to take over as a GM for it I did wind up doing quite a bit to shake up the status quo of the world even if I never got to tackle the Anathema storyline. I like to think that I did a decent job, but both playing in and running it taught me quite a bit of what not to do.

There are a lot of things that I wish I could've done with Focus, and all things considered I'm still reasonably proud of the ideas I'd had for them. That said, when going through my old notes for this I noticed a lot of things that I really could've done better as well. Some of those things were simply due to the fact I was afraid to suggest them, like Focus' main arc, but others were a result of the fact that I simply wasn't as aware of storytelling as I wished to be at the time. I planned both too much and too little with regards to things like their build and personality and I like to think that I've gotten better since then.

There are elements of Focus which have filtered into some of my newer characters in various ways. The anti-magic elements of the Anathema and the horrors therein are a major element of the Angel of the Void, while the investigator and markswoman elements have lived on in Pierce. I  have a soft spot for Isekai and self-insert narratives to this day, even if I haven't really gotten to play in one in quite a while. Still, it was probably for the best that this campaign never reached its terminal point given the degree of PVP conflict involved in my final plan.

I'm still friends with the players from this game, and some of them are in the game I'm currently running, so perhaps this time I'll have a little more success keeping a campaign going.

---------------------

Thank you for joining me on this journey down memory road, I hope it was at least mildly interesting. I potentially have a few more such stories in me in the future, depending on if I am reminded of what I intended to do with them at some point. Regardless, that's all I have for today. Please have a wonderful day and, if you feel it would be interesting, perhaps consider what you might've left on The Cutting Room Floor.
